Ultimate Hardware is a fictitous web store targeting computer hardware containing three pages.
Programming languages will include HTML and Javascript with the inclusion of Bootstrap.

Each page features a navbar for basic navigation.

From the index page we see a call to action leading us to "store.html", as well as featured products that we can add to our cart. Adding an item to the cart will take us to "cart.html". With the addition of Javascript, we will alert and ask if we'd like to continue shopping or head to"cart.html" to check out. 

The store page contains similar functionality to the index page. Clicking "Add to cart" on an item will perform actions previously mentioned.

The cart page, with the addition of Javascript, will give us buttons to remove items from our cart, as well as a checkout button that will alert that the order has been made.
